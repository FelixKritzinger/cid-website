              We couldn't be happier with the outcome of our new home. Building a home is such a complex and taxing process. 
              Sandy was instrumental in helping with the design and build our custom home. 
              She was always there any time of day or weekend to help us move forward and assist us with every detail. 
              Our builder had an aggressive timeframe, and making builder selections on time and within budget was a priority. 
              Sandy also took the time to understand our preferred style. 
              Her creativity and eye for detail made the entire project come together beautifully, 
              and she managed to get ahead of as many of the supply chain issues as possible 
              so that we could function in our new home right after we moved in...

              Sandy was wonderful to work with from beginning of our house remodel project until the end.  
              She was responsive to phone calls/emails/texts and always projected a calm confidence that made the whole process much easier 
              to live through.  She was professional and we could count on her showing up at our house whenever she was scheduled to.   
              She was also flexible when I requested a couple changes to our original plan 
              (which I asked for early enough in the process that things could still be changed out.)...

                In case the following review is too lengthy, I’ll sum it up by saying that working with Sandy was a pleasure, and the finished product is beyond my expectations.
                I worked with Sandy on the design/renovation of my newly-purchased lake house.  It was built in 1969, stood at around 2,800 square feet, and had 5 beds, 3 baths.  
                In short, it needed to be nearly gutted and redone.  I hired Sandy due largely to the style of some of her past projects being quite similar to what I had in mind.  
                Specifically, I was shooting for a rustic/industrial mix, and liked the work she had done along those lines.  
                Many other designers in the area seemed to have a style that would result more in a cookie cutter suburb-looking house that just happened to be located on a lake, 
                and less in the cozy and peaceful retreat that paid tribute to the surrounding nature vibe...

                We turned our entire house over to Collaborative Interior Design. (Seriously!) We built our home 18 years ago. We love our location and neighbors, but the house needed refreshing after years of wear and tear from our active family.  
                We didn’t have the expertise to pull off a cohesive plan, and frankly didn’t have the time.
                Sandy took care of everything.  She helped us pick a beautiful, modern color palette, and created a design plan that greatly enhanced the look and function of our home.  
                She found high quality flooring, carpeting, cabinets, fixtures, furniture and accessories for our project. Due to her extensive list of contacts, we were able to contract with the best craftsmen and tradespeople in the area.  
                Our kitchen is a cook’s dream. Our bathrooms are gorgeous, spacious and bright...

                I built a new home completed in October of 2016 and wanted to finish it after the one year warranty time was up.  I had moved belongings from both a suburban home and a northern lake house and wanted to make the furnishings all fit together, 
                which, with painting, required a whole house redo.  
                Sandy was just the ticket.  She is professional, knowledgeable, and so creative.  Where I saw blank space, she saw a vision.  
                Her ideas were in sync with mine and she always had the right person or resource to turn to to complete a task.  
                The project from start to finish seemed to complete so quickly and I'm thrilled with my new home...

                The place looks awesome...very creative.  Its a place now that I can show off.  I highly recommend Sandy!! Very pleased!

              <a href="/reviews#McDonough" class="review-text" style="text-decoration: none;">
                I started a whole-house remodel on South Street in Davidson and quickly realized the need for interior design. 
                My architect recommended Collaborative Interior Design. Sandy managed all the details from paint to flooring to fixtures and has a great understanding of the construction process. 
                She was always available at on-site meetings, at the various vendors to hand pick materials, and ad hoc when questions arose. 
                Details are so important to a home and Sandy nailed it. I am thrilled with the outcome.
