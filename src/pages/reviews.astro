        <p>We couldn't be happier with the outcome of our new home. Building a home is such a complex and taxing process. Sandy was instrumental in helping with the design and build our custom home. 
        She was always there any time of day or weekend to help us move forward and assist us with every detail. Our builder had an aggressive timeframe, and making builder selections on time and within budget was a priority. </p> 
        <p>Sandy also took the time to understand our preferred style. Her creativity and eye for detail made the entire project come together beautifully, and she managed to get ahead of as many of the supply chain issues as possible so that we could function in our new home right after we moved in.</p> 
        <p>She was an absolute pleasure to work with and extremely organized and on point. We highly recommend Sandy for any project. We LOVE our new home!!</p>

        <p>Sandy was wonderful to work with from beginning of our house remodel project until the end.  She was responsive to phone calls/emails/texts and always projected a calm confidence that made the whole process much easier to live through.  She was professional and we could count on her showing up at our house whenever she was scheduled to.   She was also flexible when I requested a couple changes to our original plan (which I asked for early enough in the process that things could still be changed out.)  </p> 
        <p>All in all, I would highly recommend Sandy and would be pleased to work with her again in the future.</p>

        <p>This was my second project with Sandy, and it was just as great of an experience as the first. This one focused on a condo renovation in Southend. The entire place needed a facelift, but the main focus was a bathroom gut rehab. 
        We went with a loft/industrial style, because the space allowed for it, and it’s also my personal preference. The end result is awesome. In terms of the experience with Sandy, the main points mirror those from my other project (Feb 2020 review).</p> 
        <p>Her approach is a collaborative one, so she and I made the decisions in partnership. We had to work together to balance our ideal scenario with the budget and with the condo’s potential market value. 
        Sandy was again helpful in weighing the costs/benefits of options, so that the selections represented good design choices AND good financial decisions. </p>  
        <p>Also, I used two of Sandy’s preferred contractors for the work. They were both excellent, in price and quality. 
        Sandy’s vendor referrals represent tangible value for me, as it saves me days of research, and I’ve yet to be disappointed with any of her people. (Many of her recommendations are folks she’s used for her own projects.)</p>
        <p>Lastly, the entire process was simply enjoyable. Even with my two projects overlapping a bit (potentially confusing and stressful), Sandy helped keep things on track and the design process was honestly fun. 
        I hope to be done with renovations for a bit.  But whenever I do tackle another project, I will definitely pull in Sandy.</p>

        <p>We turned our entire house over to Collaborative Interior Design. (Seriously!) We built our home 18 years ago. We love our location and neighbors, but the house needed refreshing after years of wear and tear from our active family.  
        We didn’t have the expertise to pull off a cohesive plan, and frankly didn’t have the time.</p> 
        <p>Sandy took care of everything.  She helped us pick a beautiful, modern color palette, and created a design plan that greatly enhanced the look and function of our home.  
        She found high quality flooring, carpeting, cabinets, fixtures, furniture and accessories for our project. Due to her extensive list of contacts, we were able to contract with the best craftsmen and tradespeople in the area. </p>  
        <p>Our kitchen is a cook’s dream. Our bathrooms are gorgeous, spacious and bright. The teenagers have fun, functional spaces that highlight their individuality and creativity. 
        Our new family room beautifully accommodates large functions and smaller gatherings. She even transformed the exterior with a new front door, planters and carriage lights. </p>
        <p>Sandy is a talented designer and an astute project manager. She was easy to work with and completed our (huge) project on time and under budget.</p>

        <p>I built a new home completed in October of 2016 and wanted to finish it after the one year warranty time was up.  I had moved belongings from both a suburban home and a northern lake house and wanted to make the furnishings all fit together, which, with painting, required a whole house redo.  
        Sandy was just the ticket.  She is professional, knowledgeable, and so creative.  Where I saw blank space, she saw a vision.  Her ideas were in sync with mine and she always had the right person or resource to turn to to complete a task.  
        The project from start to finish seemed to complete so quickly and I'm thrilled with my new home. Oh, and she's really warm with a wonderful sense of humor.  You can't go wrong.</p>
