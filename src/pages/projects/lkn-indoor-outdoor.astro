    <p>
      This home was built in the mid 1990's, has great bones and is in a wonderful neighborhood. 
      My client was looking to totally update the interior of the home and add outdoor living spaces to fully take advantage of its lakefront location. 
      We added a large back deck which created beautiful indoor-outdoor living, fully renovated the bathrooms, staircase and flooring, updated the lighting and curated all new furnishings, accesories and window treatments. 
      A crisp color palette with textural organic materials creates a comfortable and sophisticated family home.
